Could you recommend 2\u20113 evidence\u2011based pre\u2011bed habits that work well for international jet\u2011lag and can be slipped into a tight travel schedule?

Avoid blue\u2011light exposure (use a blue\u2011light filter or \u201cnight mode\u201d) for 1\u20132\u202fh before bed and then dim the lights to cue melatonin production; your wearable\u2019s light\u2011sensor data can alert you when the environment matches the recommended dimming window.\n\nSync these habits by setting your wearable\u2019s \u201csleep\u2011ready\u201d reminder to trigger when HRV, skin\u2011temperature, and ambient light data indicate bedtime readiness."

Ideally, aim for 10\u201311\u202fpm each night so the peak melatonin effect overlaps with the low\u2011night dip but doesn\u2019t coincide with the peak beta\u2011blocker suppression. Use a watch with HRV and skin\u2011temperature monitoring; a large drop in HRV or a shallow skin\u2011temperature rise during the first hour post\u2011beta\u2011blocker signals an exaggerated nocturnal BP dip. If you see those signs, delay melatonin until the second half of the hour, or adjust the dose if the trend persists."
